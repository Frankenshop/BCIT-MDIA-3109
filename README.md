BCIT-MDIA-3109
==============

Repository for MDIA 3109, Advanced Dynamic Content Design. For Henry's review.

They told me to add a read me so I did it.

I haven't added the requirements yet, it took me long enough just to get git working and to get the commit to work.
Ran into some errors that took me 2 hours to fix for whatever reason.  I don't know how I fixed it, I just ran through
the steps over and over until it worked. Who knows.  Too tired to actually do the requirements, they weren't much anyways.
Anyways, back to searching online for class books.
